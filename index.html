					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am an Australian citizen living and working in North Queensland. The highest education I have completed is Grade 12, however I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology. For the past 2 years I have been living and working in London, which was an incredible experience and opened my eyes to the exciting world of travel. Aside from travel, I enjoy rollerblading with my young nieces and nephews and spending time with my family in general.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT stems from a young age, as I always appreciated using the computer in school. I can recall starting out for the first time learning how to touch type, using the ‘Mario Touch Typing’ program. At the time I thought it was so much fun (I was also very competitive) so I quickly excelled. Little did I know that this was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to the world of computers. My first computer studies teacher was Mr. Hobson, coincidently his wife was also my maths teacher. I did not like Maths at the time, however I remember this changing by the end of the year. It is funny how certain people have a way in which they can teach you to find an appreciation for subjects that you didn’t think you could. Mr Hobson provided me with a great introduction which peaked my interest, this was evident in my career, although finance based, my position always incorporated a strong amount of IT interaction.  </p>

					<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
					<p>After hours of back and forth between degrees and career objectives, I finally landed on my Bachelor of Information Technology. I believe that by completing this degree, I will provide myself with the greatest opportunity to progress and succeed in my career. As I am still working full time whilst studying, RMIT offered the option of completing the course subjects on a personal timeline, without having to enrol and be accepted, which suited my needs.  </p>

					<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
					<p>Upon completion of my studies, I hope that I have fulfilled the requirements of the course and leave with my Bachelor of Information Technology. Although receiving my Bachelor’s degree is the ultimate goal, I do hope that my understanding of all material is sound and I can confidently move into the IT sector in a professional capacity.  </p>

					<h2>What do the results of these tests mean to me?</h2>
					<p>Having a program break down the results and explanations for each section displaying my capabilities, provides self-awareness. This information can now be used as a tool to influence my way of thinking as an individual and also in a team environment. As long as you provide honest responses to the questions, the outcome should not be overly surprising or confronting.  </p>
					<h2>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h2>
					<p>My learning behaviour is tactical; however, this exercise has shown me alternative ways of learning that other team members could potentially test for. Thus, it is important to remember that everyone is different. Ideally, I think the personality test shows that I can work well with others and potentially bring out the best in my team members. This is mind, I hope to bring enthusiasm and ideas to the group and maybe a little bit of humour. </p>
					<h2>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
					<p>In a general work setting, I do not mind taking the lead or at least involving myself in the process. Critically on my part, I know that I can also tend to take control over low functioning areas (if want something done right, do it yourself attitude), which is not always the best approach. However, I also like to think of myself as a team player and I think regardless of the circumstances I would happily accept any individual into my team. In the real world, you don’t always get to pick and choose your team members so it is important to learn how to collaborate with all learning and personality types. </p>
